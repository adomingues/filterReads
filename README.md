Set of tools to select alignments based on:
- length
- first nucleotide of sequence read

This is particularly useful for the analysis of _C. elegans_ small RNA analysis which have fairly specific properties. 

The main script is `filterReads/filterSmallRNAclasses.py`. Another script, `filterReads/summarizeNucleotideByReadLenght.py` will determine the frequency of each nucleotide per read length from any bam file. 

Use case and tutorial to come.
